- Make sure our changes are in there somewhere
- Install OpenWRT Buildroot (http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence)
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential subversion
    - git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git
    - cd openwrt
- We don't need all OpenWRT packages available, base packages and LuCI related ones are enough. (https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=16599)
    - ./scripts/feeds update packages luci
    - ./scripts/feeds install -a -p luci
- Link in our Net2LEDMatrix package
    - ln -s ~/LEDMatrixHUB75/net2ledmatrix/ package/utils/net2ledmatrix
- Link in our AR933x patch
    - ln -s ~/LEDMatrixHUB75/000-ar933x_uart_speed.patch target/linux/ar71xx/patches-3.14/
- Configure which router to compile for
    - make menuconfig
    - Go into "Target profile" and pick TP-LINK TL-WR703N
    - Go into "LuCI" -> "Collections" and enable luci (hit space twice so it gets a * instead of M).
    - Go into "Utilities" and enable net2ledmatrix with a * to preinstall it, or with an M to compile as a package.
    - Save & Exit
- Disable the serial console (because we'll be using it to communicate with the LED Matrix instead)
    - Open target/linux/ar71xx/image/Makefile
    - Find the line containing TL-WR703N (or whichever other router you use)
    - Replace ttyATH0 with ttyS0
    - It should now read something along the lines of:
   (call SingleProfile,TPLINK-LZMA,64kraw,TLWR703,tl-wr703n-v1,TL-WR703N,ttyS0,115200,0x07030101,1,4Mlzma))
- Start the compilation process
    - make
- Wait. It could take a few hours, or days.
- Your binary image should be in bin/ar71xx.
